# Mini Python projects

### Week 8

- **Project 8: File Handling and Exception Handling** - [Week 8](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week8)

- Write a program that reads data from a file, performs a specific operation (e.g., find average), and writes the result to another file. Implement exception handling. Your program should have a menu of possible operations, not only average. You must create the data file you are going to read.

- Going back to Part 1 and the PATH to the file. One problem you must fix is that the file you choose may exist in your hard drive. How would you need to do to ensure the file is available to other users. For example, if you send me your code and I try to run it, the code will fail because the file is saved in your computer - and I can't access it. What to do?
HINT: be careful when you open the file. Make sure you specify the correct and full PATH to the file, not just the name. This is a common mistake.
