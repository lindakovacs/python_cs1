# Mini Python projects

### Week 3

- **Project 3: Calculations even/odd numbers, strings length and concatenate** - [Week 3](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week3)
- Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd. Use if statements and take user input for the number.

- Write a program that reads 10 numbers. The it calculates whether each number is even or odd and displays how many are odd and how many are even.

- Write a program that reads a string. When you enter the string, think of your favorite song and enter your favorite phrase. The program should calculate the number of characters in the string and whether such number is odd or even.

- Write a program that reads two strings - Concatenate the strings and display them; then interlock the strings, i.e. take one character of string 1, then one from string 2, then one from string 1 ... and display the resulting string.

- Go back to the PONG game. Change the colors of the game anyway you want. Change them 3 times.
