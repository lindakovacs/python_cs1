# Mini Python projects

### Week 9

- **Project 9: File Handling and Exception Handling** - [Week 9](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week9)

- Using your python environment run the Hangman program attached.How many words are available in the program? And how are they chosen?
Change the program logic and add functions as necessary to allow a second player to enter a word to guess.

- Take a look at the plotting sample files attached. These routines will help you plot data points. Run them before you do anything else so you understand how they work.
Using the Covid-19 data set attached, write a python program to extract the data and analyze it. By analyzing, calculate, averages, obtain, modes max and mins on 2 or 3 data points of your choice, whichever you find more interesting.
Then, depending on your results, create a story around those numbers and write a 3-4 paragraph report.
Plot your data, do some research as to what calculations are worth developing and reporting on.
