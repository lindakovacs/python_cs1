# Mini Python projects

### Week 7

- **Project 7: Dictionaries, Contact Book, Jeopardy Game** - [Week 7](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week7)
- Build a program that acts as a simple contact book using dictionaries. Allow users to add, delete, and search for contacts.

- Build a program in python to simulate a jeopardy game. You need to have menus, options, questions and answers. You can use dictionaries for storing the questions and answers. Don't go overboard. Three categories and 3 questions/answers by category is good enough.
