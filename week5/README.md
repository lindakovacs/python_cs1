# Mini Python projects

### Week 5

- **Project 5: Imperial - Metric conversion and area calculations** - [Week 5](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week5)
- Develop a program that converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit using functions. Include user input for temperature and conversion choice, i.e., the user can select to convert C-F or vice versa, and then enter the value to be converted.

- Develop a program that converts SqFt to SqMeters and vice versa using functions. The user should be able to select what to do, i.e. convert SqFt to SqMt or SqMt to SqFt.

- Develop a program that calculates the area of at least 5 different geometric shapes using functions. The user should be to select a shape out of a menu and enter the corresponding measurements. Mandatory: Include a triangle a trapezoid.

- Develop a program to serve as a wrapper for parts 1-3. The user will pick what to do, i.e. calculate areas, convert sqft to sqmt or convert C to F.
