# Mini Python projects

### Week 4

- **Project 4: Calculations even/odd numbers, strings length and concatenate** - [Week 4](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week4)
- Implement a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number. Use a loop for user input and loop structures.

- Write a roulette game using Python. User should be able to set a bet on a specific number, and the program will randomly pick a number and either collect or payoff. Do not use random numbers. Instead, you will "simulate" how the roulette spins a number of times (X - to be entered by the user) so you will show how the numbers "spin" and then you will implement a formula of your choice to stop the roulette from spinning.

- Go back to the pong game. Write an algorithm on how you could keep the score of the game. Hint: Read the code first, figure out how the ball moves from one side of the screen to the other and then write down the algorithm.

- Modify the pong code to keep the score based on your algorithm.
