# Mini Python projects

### Week 1

- **Project 1: Pong Game** - [Week 1](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week1)
- Basic Pong Game

### Week 2

- **Project 2: Calculate rectangle area** - [Week 2](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week2)
- Create a program in python that calculates and prints the area of a rectangle. Use variables for length and width, and allow user input, i.e., the program must prompt the user to enter values for length and width.

### Week 3

- **Project 3: Calculations even/odd numbers, strings length and concatenate** - [Week 3](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week3)
- Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd. Use if statements and take user input for the number.

- Write a program that reads 10 numbers. The it calculates whether each number is even or odd and displays how many are odd and how many are even.

- Write a program that reads a string. When you enter the string, think of your favorite song and enter your favorite phrase. The program should calculate the number of characters in the string and whether such number is odd or even.

- Write a program that reads two strings - Concatenate the strings and display them; then interlock the strings, i.e. take one character of string 1, then one from string 2, then one from string 1 ... and display the resulting string.

- Go back to the PONG game. Change the colors of the game anyway you want. Change them 3 times.

### Week 4

- **Project 4: Calculations even/odd numbers, strings length and concatenate** - [Week 4](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week4)
- Implement a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number. Use a loop for user input and loop structures.

- Write a roulette game using Python. User should be able to set a bet on a specific number, and the program will randomly pick a number and either collect or payoff. Do not use random numbers. Instead, you will "simulate" how the roulette spins a number of times (X - to be entered by the user) so you will show how the numbers "spin" and then you will implement a formula of your choice to stop the roulette from spinning.

- Go back to the pong game. Write an algorithm on how you could keep the score of the game. Hint: Read the code first, figure out how the ball moves from one side of the screen to the other and then write down the algorithm.

- Modify the pong code to keep the score based on your algorithm.

### Week 5

- **Project 5: Imperial - Metric conversion and area calculations** - [Week 5](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week5)
- Develop a program that converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit using functions. Include user input for temperature and conversion choice, i.e., the user can select to convert C-F or vice versa, and then enter the value to be converted.

- Develop a program that converts SqFt to SqMeters and vice versa using functions. The user should be able to select what to do, i.e. convert SqFt to SqMt or SqMt to SqFt.

- Develop a program that calculates the area of at least 5 different geometric shapes using functions. The user should be to select a shape out of a menu and enter the corresponding measurements. Mandatory: Include a triangle a trapezoid.

- Develop a program to serve as a wrapper for parts 1-3. The user will pick what to do, i.e. calculate areas, convert sqft to sqmt or convert C to F.

### Week 6

- **Project 6: Calculations, lists, roulette game, sorting algorithm, functions, random numbers** - [Week 6](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week6)
- Create a program in python that takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the average, and identifies the highest and lowest values.

- Go back to the roulette program. Using lists keep track of the winning numbers and the betting for 20 runs of the roulette. Calculate the mode of this small dataset and how much you won or lost.

- Look up a sorting algorithm (you can google it or ask ChatGPT). Implement the algorithm in python. Using Part 2 of this assignment, run the roulette 100 times and show the results (winning number, bet) sorted by winning number.

- Take Part 3 of this assignment and make it a function where you pass a list (or a par of lists) and you get it (them) sorted.

- Using random generated numbers (do some research on how to use the appropriate library), create a list of 2000 numbers. Calculate mode, average, standard deviation, max, and min.

- Take the list of 2000 numbers from part 5. Create 6 lists and calculate mode, average, standard deviation, max, and min for each sublist. HINT: create functions for the calculations so you can call them passing a list. Display the results for each sublist.

- Go back to the pong game. Enter the names of the players and display them on the game window above their corresponding scores. (This step is optional).

### Week 7

- **Project 7: Dictionaries, Contact Book, Jeopardy Game** - [Week 7](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week7)
- Build a program that acts as a simple contact book using dictionaries. Allow users to add, delete, and search for contacts.

- Build a program in python to simulate a jeopardy game. You need to have menus, options, questions and answers. You can use dictionaries for storing the questions and answers. Don't go overboard. Three categories and 3 questions/answers by category is good enough.

### Week 8

- **Project 8: File Handling and Exception Handling** - [Week 8](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week8)

- Write a program that reads data from a file, performs a specific operation (e.g., find average), and writes the result to another file. Implement exception handling. Your program should have a menu of possible operations, not only average. You must create the data file you are going to read.

- Going back to Part 1 and the PATH to the file. One problem you must fix is that the file you choose may exist in your hard drive. How would you need to do to ensure the file is available to other users. For example, if you send me your code and I try to run it, the code will fail because the file is saved in your computer - and I can't access it. What to do?
HINT: be careful when you open the file. Make sure you specify the correct and full PATH to the file, not just the name. This is a common mistake.

### Week 9

- **Project 9: File Handling and Exception Handling** - [Week 9](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week9)

- Using your python environment run the Hangman program attached.How many words are available in the program? And how are they chosen?
Change the program logic and add functions as necessary to allow a second player to enter a word to guess.

- Take a look at the plotting sample files attached. These routines will help you plot data points. Run them before you do anything else so you understand how they work.
Using the Covid-19 data set attached, write a python program to extract the data and analyze it. By analyzing, calculate, averages, obtain, modes max and mins on 2 or 3 data points of your choice, whichever you find more interesting.
Then, depending on your results, create a story around those numbers and write a 3-4 paragraph report.
Plot your data, do some research as to what calculations are worth developing and reporting on.

### Week 10

- **Project 10: File Handling and Exception Handling** - [Week 10](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week10)

- Design a class representing a basic bank account. Implement methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

- Go back to the pong game. Implement the code to keep the score of the game and display it.

### Week 11

- **Project 11: Inheritance** - [Week 11](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week11)

- Extend the bank account program from the previous week to include multiple account types (e.g., savings, checking) using inheritance.

- Go back to the pong game. You have implemented the score keeping mechanism. Now, write code to stop the game once a player gets to 7 points. Print a message saying "XX Player Wins!!"

### Week 12

- **Project 12: Libraries** - [Week 12](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week12)

- Utilize the math library to create a program that calculates the area and of different geometric shapes. The user should be able to select a shape and pass the corresponding measures.

- Back to the pong game. You have implemented the score keeping mechanism and now once a player gets to 7 points the game is over. Write code to enter the players names and upload a picture of the players.
