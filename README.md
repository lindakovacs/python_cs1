# Mini Python projects

### Week 1

- **Project 1: Pong Game** - [Week 1](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week1)
- Basic Pong Game

### Week 2

- **Project 2: Calculate rectangle area** - [Week 2](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week2)
- Create a program in python that calculates and prints the area of a rectangle. Use variables for length and width, and allow user input, i.e., the program must prompt the user to enter values for length and width.

### Week 3

- **Project 3: Calculations even/odd numbers, strings length and concatenate** - [Week 3](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week3)
- Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd. Use if statements and take user input for the number.

- Write a program that reads 10 numbers. The it calculates whether each number is even or odd and displays how many are odd and how many are even.

- Write a program that reads a string. When you enter the string, think of your favorite song and enter your favorite phrase. The program should calculate the number of characters in the string and whether such number is odd or even.

- Write a program that reads two strings - Concatenate the strings and display them; then interlock the strings, i.e. take one character of string 1, then one from string 2, then one from string 1 ... and display the resulting string.

- Go back to the PONG game. Change the colors of the game anyway you want. Change them 3 times.

### Week 4

- **Project 4: Calculations even/odd numbers, strings length and concatenate** - [Week 4](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week4)
- Implement a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number. Use a loop for user input and loop structures.

- Write a roulette game using Python. User should be able to set a bet on a specific number, and the program will randomly pick a number and either collect or payoff. Do not use random numbers. Instead, you will "simulate" how the roulette spins a number of times (X - to be entered by the user) so you will show how the numbers "spin" and then you will implement a formula of your choice to stop the roulette from spinning.

- Go back to the pong game. Write an algorithm on how you could keep the score of the game. Hint: Read the code first, figure out how the ball moves from one side of the screen to the other and then write down the algorithm.

- Modify the pong code to keep the score based on your algorithm.

### Week 5

- **Project 5: Imperial - Metric conversion and area calculations** - [Week 5](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week5)
- Develop a program that converts temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit using functions. Include user input for temperature and conversion choice, i.e., the user can select to convert C-F or vice versa, and then enter the value to be converted.

- Develop a program that converts SqFt to SqMeters and vice versa using functions. The user should be able to select what to do, i.e. convert SqFt to SqMt or SqMt to SqFt.

- Develop a program that calculates the area of at least 5 different geometric shapes using functions. The user should be to select a shape out of a menu and enter the corresponding measurements. Mandatory: Include a triangle a trapezoid.

- Develop a program to serve as a wrapper for parts 1-3. The user will pick what to do, i.e. calculate areas, convert sqft to sqmt or convert C to F.
