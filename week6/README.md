# Mini Python projects

### Week 6

- **Project 6: Calculations, lists, roulette game, sorting algorithm, functions, random numbers** - [Week 6](https://github.com/lindakovacs/python_cs1/tree/main/week6)
- Create a program in python that takes a list of numbers as input, calculates the average, and identifies the highest and lowest values.

- Go back to the roulette program. Using lists keep track of the winning numbers and the betting for 20 runs of the roulette. Calculate the mode of this small dataset and how much you won or lost.

- Look up a sorting algorithm (you can google it or ask ChatGPT). Implement the algorithm in python. Using Part 2 of this assignment, run the roulette 100 times and show the results (winning number, bet) sorted by winning number.

- Take Part 3 of this assignment and make it a function where you pass a list (or a par of lists) and you get it (them) sorted.

- Using random generated numbers (do some research on how to use the appropriate library), create a list of 2000 numbers. Calculate mode, average, standard deviation, max, and min.

- Take the list of 2000 numbers from part 5. Create 6 lists and calculate mode, average, standard deviation, max, and min for each sublist. HINT: create functions for the calculations so you can call them passing a list. Display the results for each sublist.

- Go back to the pong game. Enter the names of the players and display them on the game window above their corresponding scores. (This step is optional).
